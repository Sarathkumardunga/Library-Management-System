# Library-Management-System
This project is to implement few of the functions that can be handful while managing a University Library.
All the functions were implemented using C++ .
This was completely implemented using LINKED LIST Data Structure.
All my motive behind this project was to form a Base for Library Management system which can be further developed using Javascript.
